This paper first defines the short-duration speaker verification problem, the sub-3sec problem, which has rarely been discussed in previous speaker recognition research. Then, we propose a fully automatic pipeline to derive a text-dependent
speaker verification corpus from a text-independent speaker verification corpus. Using this approach, we curate the Sub3Vox corpus from VoxCeleb1. It consists of 1,250 speakers, 250.43
hours of speech, and 1,769,131 unique utterances. The number of speakers and the number of unique utterances are nearly the same as in the original VoxCeleb1, while the total speaking hours are less because they are short utterances trimmed from VoxCeleb1. We report the baselines for speaker verification tested on the proposed Sub3Vox corpus.
